# Patient-Preprocessing

This is MATLAB code for various preprocessing operations (registration, reslicing, denoising, segmentation, etc.) of neuroimaging data. It takes as input nifti files and produces copies of this data to which the requested preprocessing steps are applied. It additionally handles image data with pairied label masks (e.g., a T1w MRI and a tumour mask), and makes sure that the resulting preprocessed data is consistent. See below for some example use cases, which could be run stand-alone or be inspiration for more complicated preprocessing tasks.

## Dependencies

The algorithm requires that the following package is on the MATLAB path:
* **SPM12:** Download from https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12.
* **spm_superres:** Download/clone from https://github.com/brudfors/spm_superres (if you want to use the denoising or super-resolution options).

## Use cases

### 1. Multi-channel MRI segmentation

This MATLAB snippet that takes as input MR images of multiple sequences and produces images that have been co-registered and resliced. These images are then segmented using the SPM12 unified segmentation routine and outputs are written.
```
% Paths to multi-channel images
pth_img = {'MRI_T1w.nii', 'MRI_T2w.nii', 'MRI_PDw.nii'};  % Paths to image data nifti files as cell array

% Format input
data = nifti(pth_img);

% Set preprocessing options
opt             = struct;    
opt.dir_out     = 'output'; % Output directory
opt.do.coreg    = true;     % Co-register using NMI
opt.do.reslice  = true;     % Reslice to have same image grids
opt.reslice.ref = 1;        % Reslice to image pth_img(1)
opt.do.segment  = true;     % Enable unified segmentation
    
% Run preprocessing
RunPreproc(data, opt);
```

### 2. Image with label mask

This MATLAB snippet that takes as input an image and a label mask (both as niftis) and produces images that have been: rigidly realigned (to MNI space), cropped of neck and air data, made to have 2 mm isotropic voxel size, and made to have the same field-of-view as the SPM12 atlas. This code could be run on, for example, multiple subjects' images to produce input to some machine learning model.
```
% Format input
data    = cell(1, 2);
data{1} = nifti('img.nii');    % Give image nifti here
data{2} = nifti('labels.nii'); % Give label nifti here

% Set preprocessing options
opt                = struct;    
opt.dir_out        = 'output'; % Output directory
opt.do.real_mni    = true;     % Rigid alignment to MNI
opt.do.crop        = true;     % Remove air data (makes for smaller image)
opt.crop.keep_neck = false;    % Remove also neck (makes for even smaller image)
opt.do.vx          = true;     % Change voxel size
opt.vx.size        = 2;        % What voxel size do you want?
opt.do.bb_spm      = true;     % Make image have same bounding-box as default SPM12 template
  
% Run preprocessing
RunPreproc(data, opt);
```

### 3. MRI denoising (requires spm_superres)

This MATLAB snippet that takes as input an MR image and applies a total variation denoising routine to it [1].
```
% Format input
data = nifti('MRI.nii');  % Give MRI nifti here

% Set preprocessing options
opt            = struct;    
opt.dir_out    = 'output'; % Output directory
opt.do.denoise = true;     % Enabel denoising
    
% Run preprocessing
RunPreproc(data, opt);
```

### 4. Multi-channel MRI super-resolution (requires spm_superres)

This MATLAB snippet that takes as input thick-sliced, multi-channel MR images and applies a super-resolution routine to it [1]; producing 1 mm isotropic images on the same grid.
```
% Paths to multi-channel images
pth_img = {'MRI_T1w.nii', 'MRI_T2w.nii', 'MRI_PDw.nii'};  % Paths to image data nifti files as cell array

% Format input
data = nifti(pth_img);

% Set preprocessing options
opt             = struct;    
opt.dir_out     = 'output'; % Output directory
opt.do.superres = true;     % Enable super-resolution
    
% Run preprocessing
RunPreproc(data, opt);
```
